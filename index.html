<h3>JIDs for Messaging with Phones</h3>
</div>
<p>
JMP gives you a real phone number for sending picture and text messages right
from a <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html">Jabber</a> account.
</p>

<p>
Text with friends cross-border without paying international texting
fees, chat with friends over SMS even if you don't have a cell phone,
or add an extra number for business or privacy.
</p>


<p>

We are busy squirreling code away on new features including an easy JMP app!
To get low-volume notifications of our progress,
<a href="notify_signup/">add your email address to our list</a>.
</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="signup" style="text-align:center;">Signup (30-day free trial!)</h3>
<p>
To register for JMP, begin by choosing a <i>federated</i> JID (Jabber ID) to link to your new number --
you can change it later, but you need one to start with. There are <a href="https://xmpp.net/directory.php">many</a>
free and open servers available which you can use with any client; one of the smoothest options is to install the
<a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> Android app and follow the prompts to sign up on their server.
</p>

<p>
<em>If</em> you want to enable incoming voice calls, you will need one of the
following for call forwarding: an existing Canadian or US phone number (can be
voice-only, no Touch-Tone needed), an <a href="https://www.inum.net/">iNum</a>,
or a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2010/01/voip-in-depth-an-introduction-to-the-sip-protocol-part-1/">SIP</a>
address.  Voicemail right in your chat history is
<a href="notify_signup/">in the works</a>.
</p>

<p>
Next, pick a JMP number.  Here are a few we found for you:

<iframe style="border:0;width:18rem;height:14rem;"
	src="register1/num_find.php"></iframe>

</div>
<p style="text-align:center;">
Or search <a href="register1/">by area code</a> to find even more numbers.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
You can also <a href="#existing">bring your own number</a> to JMP if you like.
</p>

<p class="warning"> <!-- FIXME: add css for this class -->
<b>Note:</b> While JMP does provide phone numbers and voice/SMS features, JMP is
not a telephone company and it does not provide 911, 112, 999 or other emergency
services over voice or SMS.  Please ensure that your existing telephony provider
supports those services.
</p>

<h3 id="upgrade" style="text-align:center;">Upgrade to Paid Account</h3>

<p>
If you've signed up for the free trial and would like to upgrade to unlimited
text and picture message for the duration of the <a href="#pricing">beta</a>
period, you can <a href="upgrade1/">upgrade to a paid account here</a>.  JMP is
currently available for US$2.99 per month or US$34.99 per year.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
</div>

<dl>
<dt id="features">Q1. What do I get when I signup for JMP?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
JMP gives you a Canadian or US phone number that is yours to keep.  JMP allows
you to send and receive text messages and picture messages using your XMPP
client, as well as to receive voice calls, which are forwarded to your existing
Canadian or US phone number (or <a href="https://www.inum.net/">iNum</a> or
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2010/01/voip-in-depth-an-introduction-to-the-sip-protocol-part-1/">SIP</a>
address).
</p><p>

</p>
</dd>

<dt id="jabber">Q2. What's this Jabber thing?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Jabber, or XMPP, is a
<!-- FIXME: add links around each of the services here -->
<a href="https://xmpp.org/about/history.html">long-standing</a>,
widely-used, privacy-focused and open chat protocol. If you have ever used
<a href="https://developers.google.com/talk/open_communications">Google Chat</a>,
HipChat, the pre-2016 Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Kik,
<a href="https://movim.eu">Movim</a>,
<a href="https://blog.process-one.net/google-cloud-messaging-update-boosted-by-xmpp/">Android Push Notifications</a>,
or a private company chat server, then you have used XMPP.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the private servers, the <a href="https://xmpp.net/">public XMPP network</a>
is and always will be a federated system, which means that like email or the web,
anyone on any server can communicate with anyone else without artificial
limitations.
</p>
<p>
JMP extends the freedom of the XMPP network to cell phone texting.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="sending">Q3. How do I send text messages?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Text messages are sent and received using special Jabber IDs (JIDs).  To send a
text message, first add the JID representing the destination phone number to
your roster.  For example, to send a text message to +1 416 993 8000 you would
add "+14169938000@cheogram.com" to your roster.  You can then send
the contact a message or picture and they will receive it as an SMS/MMS message.
</p><p>
To send text messages to short codes, use the special suffix for short codes,
ie. "33733;phone-context=ca-us.phone-context.soprani.ca@cheogram.com"
represents the 33733 short code.  This will be simplified in the future, but is
required for now in order to maintain proper uniqueness going forward.
</p>
</dd>


<dt id="pricing">Q4. How much does JMP cost?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
JMP is completely free of charge for the first 30 days!  During this trial
period you can send up to 300 text or pictures messages and receive up to 30
minutes of voice calls.  And you can receive as many text and picture messages
as you like.
</p>
<p>
At any time within the first 30 days you can <a href="upgrade1/">upgrade to a
paid account</a> to send and receive unlimited text and picture messages, as
well as use up to 60 minutes of incoming voice calls per month.  JMP is
currently in beta - the introductory rate for beta users is US$2.99 per month
(or US$34.99 per year).
</p>
<p>
Once the beta period for JMP is over, the US$2.99/month and US$34.99/year
subscriptions will still be available and will still have unlimited incoming SMS
and MMS, but the number of outgoing SMS/MMS will be limited; other plans will be
available.
</p>
<p>
You may cancel your subscription at any time (via PayPal or by <a
href="#support">contacting the support team</a>). After cancellation (or after
your trial period expires), your number will be reclaimed after 30 days unless
you
<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/porting-keeping-your-phone-number-when-you-change-providers">port</a>
it to another carrier.
</p>
<p>
The beta period will last until at least June 2017, and a new unlimited
messaging plan will be made available once the beta period has ended.  After the
beta period, additional <a href="#payment">non-PayPal methods of payment</a> will be
made available.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="support">Q5. How do I get help with JMP?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The best venue for help using or developing features for JMP is the
Soprani.ca chatroom at
<a href="xmpp:discuss@conference.soprani.ca?join">discuss@conference.soprani.ca</a>,
accessible from most XMPP clients.  It is an active and enthusiastic channel,
and the fastest way to solve problems with the developers or other users.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to send a private inquiry instead, or if you cannot join the chatroom,
send a text message to the support team at
<a href="sms:+14199938000">+1 416 993 8000</a> (Canada) or
<a href="sms:+13127968000">+1 312 796 8000</a> (US)
and we will get back to you within 24 hours.  Both numbers can be texted from most other countries,
though your carrier may charge a fee for international text messaging.

You can use any XMPP client you like.  If a client doesn't work for some reason,
please <a href="https://gitlab.com/ossguy/sgx-catapult/issues">file a
ticket</a> or <a href="#support">discuss it with the team</a>.  JMP is normally
tested with <a href="https://gajim.org/">Gajim</a> and <a
href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a>, since they both support the
needed XEPs for JMP's complete feature set (which includes XEP-0184, XEP-0234,
and XEP-0261, among others).
