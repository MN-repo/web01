= jmp-register =

The registration wizard for JMP.  This wizard requires sgx-catapult and
jmp-fwdcalls to operate.  It also requires a PayPal premier/merchant account.

The project should run on any web server configured to serve PHP (and to show
index.php and index.xhtml as default directory pages) that has phpredis (ie. the
php5-redis package in Debian).

A PayPal subscription button must be setup and the details configured below.
jmp-register is configured by default to use the PayPal Sandbox - in order to
run jmp-register in production you must change "sandbox.paypal" to "paypal" (in
register6/index.php and register7/index.php ).

Note that a settings file must be placed at ../../../../settings-jmp.php
(relative to register3/index.php for example).  The file must define these
variables:

* $support_number (an sgx-catapult hosted E.164 number to send from)
* $fwdcalls_url (the "Voice Callback" URL that jmp-fwdcalls makes available)
* $sgx_url (the Bandwidth AP "Messaging Callback" URL sgx-catapult uses)
* $register_base_url (the "http://a.b/c" in "http://a.b/c/register3/index.php")
* $paypal_receiver_email (where button delivers funds, ie. "user%40example.com")
* $paypal_price_per_month (price that subscription button configured to charge)
* $paypal_pdt_token (your PayPal "PDT identity token" - see settings pages)
* $paypal_input_tags (the code for your PayPal button minus the <form>/</form>)
* $redis_host (should match what sgx-catapult uses)
* $redis_port (should match what sgx-catapult uses)
* $redis_auth (should match what sgx-catapult uses; empty string if no auth)
* $key_ttl_seconds (recommended: 3600)
* $user (the user ID of the Bandwidth AP user being used; starts with "u-")
* $tuser (the Bandwidth AP "Api Token" that sgx-catapult uses; starts with "t-")
* $token (the Bandwidth AP "Api Secret" that sgx-catapult uses)
