= jmp-register =

The registration wizard for JMP.  This wizard requires sgx-catapult to operate.

The project should run on any web server configured to serve PHP (and to show
index.php and index.xhtml as default directory pages) that has phpredis (ie. the
php5-redis package in Debian).

Note that a settings file must be placed at ../../../../settings-jmp.php
(relative to register3/index.php for example).  The file must define these
variables: $support_number (an sgx-catapult hosted E.164 number to send from),
$sgx_url (the Bandwidth AP "Messaging Callback" URL sgx-catapult uses), and also
variables: $redis_host and $redis_port (should match what sgx-catapult uses),
$redis_auth (empty string if no auth), $key_ttl_seconds (recommended: 3600), and
$user (the user ID of the Bandwidth AP user being used; starts with "u-") and
$tuser and $token (the same Bandwidth AP credentials that sgx-catapult uses).
