<h3>Suggested XMPP Servers for use with <a href="https://jmp.chat/">JMP</a></h3>
</div>
<p>
If you don't have an XMPP account yet, here are a number of good XMPP servers
you can choose from to create an account.  You can generally register with these
right from your <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html">XMPP client</a>
(using the "register for a new account" option or similar), but many of them
will also let you register via the web.
</p>

<p>
In case you don't want to look through all of them, we recommend going with the
first option.  <a href="https://jmp.chat/">JMP</a> will work with virtually any
XMPP server, though, so if you rather a different one, that's completely fine.
</p>

<p>
If you are an XMPP server operator and are wondering why your server isn't
listed here, please try to get your server listed on Daniel Gultsch's
<a href="https://gultsch.de/compliance_ranked.html">XMPP Compliance Suite Server
Test Results</a> page with primarily "green" results.  If for some reason that
isn't possible, please <a href="./#support">contact us</a> with the results of
running the <a href="https://github.com/iNPUTmice/ComplianceTester">XMPP
Compliance Tester</a> yourself.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, please ensure that your server supports
<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html">in-band registration</a>.
You can use a CAPTCHA if you want to, but we won't list a server here unless
in-band registration is supported.  We also tend to only list servers that offer
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gratis#Adjective">gratis</a> accounts
and that do not otherwise restrict who can create an account.
