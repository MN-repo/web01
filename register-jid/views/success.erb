If you have not yet received a message, then your XMPP server (or
client) may be preventing you from receiving text messages from phone numbers
that are new to you.  For details, see <a href="../faq/#blocking">the FAQ section
on message blocking</a>.  You may switch to a different XMPP server (perhaps from
<a href="../suggested_servers.html">our suggested servers list</a>) by creating
an account at one, then pressing Back and using your new JID instead.  Or,
press Reload to try sending the code to the same JID again.
