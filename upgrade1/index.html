<h3>Upgrade to a paid JMP account</h3>
</div>
<p>
If you're happy with your <a href="../">JMP</a> free trial so far, you can
upgrade to a paid account at any time within the first 30 days.  There are
currently two options for paid accounts: US$2.99/month or US$34.99/year (a 2.5%
savings).
</p>

<p>
Once you've completed the payment process, you'll receive unlimited incoming and
outgoing text and picture messages, and 60 minutes of incoming voice calls per
month.
</p>

<p>
Note that unlimited text and picture messages will last for the duration of the
payment period that you choose.  After that, if JMP is still in beta (as it will
be until at least June 2017), your account will auto-renew with unlimited text
and picture messages.  If JMP is no longer in beta, then your account will be
automatically updated to a new account type with limited outgoing text and
picture messages, but will keep unlimited incoming text and picture messages.
There will be other account options at that time if you wish to keep the
unlimited outgoing text and picture messages.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to use a payment method other than PayPal, please <a
href="../#payment">contact us</a>.  Otherwise please enter your JMP number or
Jabber ID (JID) below:
