Payment information incomplete - no transaction ID was received.  If you believe
that your payment succeeded, please contact support to finish your registration.
Otherwise, please <a href="../upgrade1/">start again</a> to complete the
payment.  You can contact support by replying to the verification message you
received in your XMPP client (or, equivalently, send an XMPP message to <a href=
"xmpp:+14169938000@cheogram.com">+14169938000@cheogram.com</a>), sending a text
message with the details to +1 416 993 8000 (Canada) or +1 312 796 8000 (US), or
by sending a private message to "ossguy" in the JMP/Soprani.ca MUC at <a
href="xmpp:discuss@conference.soprani.ca?join">discuss@conference.soprani.ca</a>

The payment was not received or there was an error verifying your transaction.
It is unlikely that a payment was charged, but it would help to confirm this.
If you know that no payment was charged, you can <a href="../upgrade1/">start
again</a>.  Or, contact support by replying to the verification message you
received in your XMPP client (or, equivalently, send an XMPP message to <a href=
"xmpp:+14169938000@cheogram.com">+14169938000@cheogram.com</a>), sending a text
message with the details to +1 416 993 8000 (Canada) or +1 312 796 8000 (US), or
by sending a private message to "ossguy" in the JMP/Soprani.ca MUC at <a

<div style="text-align:center;">
<h3>You've been upgraded!</h3>
</div>

<p>
We've received your payment for the JMP account with <?php echo $id_text ?>.
Your paid account upgrade is complete - you can now send unlimited text and
picture messages!
</p>

<p>
Note that unlimited text and picture messages will last for the duration of your
current payment period.  After that, if JMP is still in beta (as it will be
until at least August 2017), your account will auto-renew with unlimited text and
picture messages.  If JMP is no longer in beta, then your account will be
automatically updated to a new account type with limited outgoing text and
picture messages, but will keep unlimited incoming text and picture messages.
There will be other account options at that time if you wish to keep the
unlimited outgoing text and picture messages.
</p>

<p>
In the unlikely event that there is ever an issue with a JMP payment, we will
reach out to you by messaging your JMP number within 5 business days to resolve
it.  If you ever have any questions or concerns, please feel free to
<a href="../#support">contact us</a>.  Thanks for being a JMP customer!
