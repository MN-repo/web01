<h1>JMP - beta</h1>
<h3>JIDs for Messaging with Phones</h3>
</div>
<p>
JMP gives you a real phone number for sending picture and text messages right
from your existing XMPP account.
</p><p>
(If you are unfamiliar with XMPP, you can learn more <a
href="https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html">here</a>.  Or, to be notified when
the JMP app is ready to use, <a href="notify_signup/">add your email address
to our list</a>.)
</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Signup</h3>
<p>
To register for JMP, begin by picking a <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_Numbering_Plan_area_codes"
>NANP area code</a> to see if JMP numbers are available there; if you're unsure,
numbers are normally available in at least 613 (Ottawa area) and 312 (Chicago):
</p>
<form action="register1/">
<p>
Area code: <input type="text" name="areacode" /> (ie. 647 for Toronto, 617 for
Boston area, or 604 for Vancouver area) <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</p>
</form>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> While JMP does provide phone numbers and voice/SMS features, JMP is
not a telephone company and it does not provide 911, 112, 999 or other emergency
services over voice or SMS.  Please ensure that your existing telephony provider
supports those services.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
</div>
<dl>
<dt id="q1">Q1. What do I get when I signup for JMP?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
JMP gives you a Canadian or US phone number that is yours to keep.  JMP allows
you to send and receive text messages and picture messages using your XMPP
client, as well as to receive voice calls, which are forwarded to your existing
Canadian or US phone number.
</p><p>
Some examples use cases include: texting friends in another country (ie. the US
if you are in Canada) who can then reply without paying international texting
fees, or chatting with friends over SMS using a real phone number even if you
don't have or want a cell phone.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id="q2">Q2. What do I need in order to signup for and use JMP?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Signing up for JMP requires only the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a federated XMPP account (an easy way to get one is with <a
href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a>)</li>
<li>a Canadian or US phone number (can be voice-only, no Touch-Tone needed);
support for using a SIP URI instead is <a href="notify_signup/">in the
works</a></li>
<li>payment details (see <a href="#q3">below</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt id="q3">Q3. How much does JMP cost?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
JMP is currently in beta and the introductory rate for beta users is US$2.99 per
month.  This includes unlimited SMS and MMS, as well as 50 minutes of incoming
voice calls.
</p><p>
You may cancel your subscription at any time (via PayPal or by <a
href="#support">contacting the support team</a>). If you have chosen not to port
your JMP number to a different carrier, your JMP number will be reclaimed after
30 days.
</p><p>
Once the beta period for JMP is over, the US$2.99 subscription will still be
available and will still have unlimited incoming SMS and MMS, but it will be
limited to 100 outgoing SMS or MMS per month.
</p><p>
The beta period will last until at least April 2017, and a new unlimited
messaging plan will be made available once the beta period has ended.  After the
beta period, additional <a href="#q7">non-PayPal methods of payment</a> will be
made available.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id="q4">Q4. How do I get help with JMP or learn more about it?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The best venue for help using or developing features for JMP is the
JMP/Soprani.ca multi-user chat (MUC, or group chat) room at <a
href="xmpp:discuss@conference.soprani.ca?join">discuss@conference.soprani.ca</a>
, accessible from most XMPP clients.  Your questions can be answered most
quickly there as several JMP users and developers are likely to be present at
any given time.
</p><p id="support">
If you'd like to send a private inquiry instead, or if the MUC
does not work for you for some reason, please send a text message to the support
team at +1 416 993 8000 (Canada) or +1 312 796 8000 (US) and we will get back to
you within 24 hours.  Both numbers can be texted from most other countries,
though your carrier may charge an extra fee for international text messaging.
</p><p>
All of the software that makes up JMP is free and open source software.  You can
view, download, and modify the source code <a
href="https://gitlab.com/users/ossguy/projects">here</a>.

href="notify_signup/">here</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id="q5">Q5. Which text messaging features are supported?</dt>
<dd>
<p>JMP supports the following text messaging features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send and receive text and picture messages (SMS and MMS) between your JMP
number and any other Canadian or US phone number.</li>
<li>Send and receive text and picture messages with most Canadian and US short
codes.  For example, you can send "info" to 33733 and receive the reply.</li>
<li>Use any emoji or other Unicode character in your text messages.</li>
<li>Delivery receipts, as indicated by the carrier.  To receive these for a
given contact, they must be in your contact list (roster).</li>
<li>Receive group text messages (the list of recipients will be available in a
future release).</li>
<li>Receive text messages from most countries in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>JMP does not (yet) support these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send group text messages.</li>
<li>Send text messages to countries outside the US and Canada.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt id="q6">Q6. How do I send text messages?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Text messages are sent and receive using special Jabber IDs (JIDs).  To send a
text message, first add the JID representing the destination phone number to
your roster.  For example, to send a text message to +1 416 993 8000 you would
add "+14169938000@catapult.sgx.soprani.ca" to your roster.  You can then send
the contact a message or picture and they will receive it as an SMS/MMS message.
</p><p>
To send text messages to short codes, use the special suffix for short codes,
ie. "33733;phone-context=ca-us.phone-context.soprani.ca@catapult.sgx.soprani.ca"
represents the 33733 short code.  This will be simplified in the future, but is
required for now in order to maintain proper uniqueness going forward.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id="q7">Q7. Do I have to use PayPal to signup for JMP?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No.  Other payment methods are available.  For details, please contact our
support team by sending a text message to +1 416 993 8000 (Canada) or
+1 312 796 8000 (US) or send a private message to "ossguy" in the JMP/Soprani.ca
MUC at <a
href="xmpp:discuss@conference.soprani.ca?join">discuss@conference.soprani.ca</a>
.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id="q8">Q8. Can I port my existing number into JMP?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, but the process is not currently automated, and may take 1-2 weeks,
depending on the number being ported in.  For details, please contact our
support team by sending a text message to +1 416 993 8000 (Canada) or
+1 312 796 8000 (US) or send a private message to "ossguy" in the JMP/Soprani.ca
MUC at <a
href="xmpp:discuss@conference.soprani.ca?join">discuss@conference.soprani.ca</a>
.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id="q9">Q9. Which XMPP clients are supported?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
You can use any XMPP client you like.  If a client doesn't work for some reason,
please <a href="https://gitlab.com/ossguy/sgx-catapult/issues">file a
ticket</a> or <a href="#q4">discuss it with the team</a>.  JMP is normally
tested with <a href="https://gajim.org/">Gajim</a> and <a
href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a>, since they both support the
needed XEPs for JMP's complete feature set (which includes XEP-0184, XEP-0234,
and XEP-0261, among others).
